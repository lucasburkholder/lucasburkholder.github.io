            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>For a project in my Audio Signal Processing class III class, I wanted to create a guitar synthesizer that could
                sound realistic but not use as much memory as a fully multi-sampled guitar. I started by using the Karplus-Strong
                algorithm, which is one of the most basic ways to synthesize a plucked string.
            </p>
            <p><img src="../images/kstrong.png" style="width:40%" class="w3-image project-img img-left" alt="Karplus-Strong Algorithm">
                The Karplus-Strong algorithm, shown left, works by using a delay line to simulate a transverse wave (such as a pluck)
                traveling along a guitar string from the nut to the bridge and back. It uses a noise burst to simulate the excitation,
                or the actual pluck of the string, and a filter in the delay loop to simulate the absorption of high frequencies by 
                the physical properties of the guitar. It sounds kind of accurate, but I wanted to make it sound even better.</p>
            <p>I came across <a href="https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~ronw/dsp/" target="_blank">this article</a> from Columbia by 
                Steven Sanders and Ron Weiss, in which they improve the original algorithm by using a more accurate filter and exciter
                signal. They used MATLAB to analyze an actual recording of a guitar pluck and generate filter coefficients and an 
                exciter signal. The result was a much more accurate sounding guitar pluck.</p>
            <p>I used some of their MATLAB scripts with my own guitar pluck sample to generate a loop filter and exciter signal.
                I then did some processing to my exciter signal to remove unwanted ringing, and finally implemented the algorithm in 
                JUCE using C++ to create a plugin. A demo video of the final plugin is shown above.
            </p>
