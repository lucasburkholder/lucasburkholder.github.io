                    <p>I have always been a big fan of west coast rappers like Snoop Dogg, Warren G, Nate Dogg, and Dr. Dre, and
                        the smooth G-Funk hip-hop beats that they rap over. A music producer myself, I decided I wanted to try making 
                        my own G-Funk beats. A friend suggested that I would need a nice analog synthesizer to get the high-pitched
                        lead synth sound found in most G-Funk music (<a href="https://youtu.be/dwWUXZtv2C0?t=5" target="_blank">see
                            an example here</a>), and I figured I could just make my own. The synth I made
                        reads MIDI notes at its input, and generates an analog audio signal at its output.</p>

                    <h2>Design</h2>
                    <p>The final version of my synth circuit involved a square-wave clock signal from the Arduino repeatedly discharging 
                        a capacitor through a transistor and allowing it to re-charge. This generated a sawtooth wave signal, which 
                        then went through an adjustable low-pass filter to get the final output tone. </p>

                    <h3>The hardware</h3>
                        <img src="../images/synth_newdesign.png" class="w3-image project-img">
                        <p>Above, you can see the schematic for the final synthesizer PCB. It has two circuits, one of which interfacing
                            between a MIDI keyboard and the Arduino, the other one interfacing with the Arduino to create an audio signal.

                            The square-wave clock signal is turned into short voltage spikes by the RC differentiator at the top left,
                            and the resulting voltage spikes discharge capacitor C4 through the transistor. After the capacitor discharges,
                            it begins charging again, linearly, until the next clock cycle. This happens at the frequency of the clock 
                            signal coming from the Arduino, creating a sawtooth wave.

                        and <code class="w3-codespan">glideToFreq()</code>, which handle MIDI "note on" messages, and calculate output frequencies, respectively.

                    <h2>Approach</h2>
                    <p>The G-Funk synth uses an Arduino microcontroller with a DAC chip to generate
                        a control voltage, corresponding to the MIDI note it receives. In the first design, it generated that pitch 
                        using a 555 timer. The timer would charge or discharge a capacitor for a duration that depended on the 
                        control voltage, which would then control the frequency of the square wave output.</p>
                    <p>This design worked to an extent, but it had a lot of variables including the strength of the electrical
                        connections, and the temperature of the wires and resistors. These would actually change the frequency 
                        of the signal, causing the synth to easily go out of tune.

                        I realized there was a better way to do it. Inspired by the design of the Roland 
                        Juno synthesizers, and borrowing heavily from the article I read, I made a new design that, instead of using
                        a 555 timer, a capacitor, and resistors to generate the sound, used a clock signal from the Arduino. 
                        To learn more about the design for the DCO (digitally controlled oscillator), give the article a read.
                        It explains in very simple terms the electronics behind DCO's and VCO's and how they work.</p>

                    <p>As far as the software, the biggest challenge was writing code that can read a "glide time" parameter
                        from a potentiometer wired to the Arduino and slide the output signal between those frequencies (like "legato mode"
                        on most synthesizers). I tried a few methods before eventually landing on one that worked. The final design 
                        calculates the distance (in hz) between the two frequencies and the speed at which it must glide between them,
                        then uses a while loop to repeatedly increment the frequency and delay by 1 millisecond, until it reaches the 
                        frequency of the key that was pressed.

                        The hardware design and fitting the DCO circuit onto a PCB was actually fairly simple, but fitting it all 
                        into an enclosure turned out to be a challenge. I learned that I had to not only design the final product,
                        but also engineer the enclosure so that the final product could be assembled.
